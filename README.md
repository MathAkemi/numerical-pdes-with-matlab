# numerical-pdes-with-matlab

The purpose of this repository is to store the code I wrote for an independent study in numerical PDEs during the Fall 2023 semester. These programs should demonstrate my knowledge at implementing techniques of solving PDEs in MATLAB and at mathematical computing in general. The code was written following the book "Numerical solutions of partial differential equations" by Dr. Louise Olsen-Kettle. Within the book, MATLAB solutions were provided, which were used to check the base of my work.

The programs hosted here include:

* Heat Equation:
    * Backward Euler method (backwardEuler.m)
    * Forward Euler method (forwardEuler.m)
    * Crank-Nicholson (CrankNicholson.m)
    * Method of Lines (methodOfLines.m)
* Numerical Linear Algebra:
    * Jacobi method (jacobi.m)
    * Gauss Seidel w/ relaxation and error analysis (GaussSeidel.m)
* Solitons and KDV:
    * Spectral method (spectralMethod.m)
    * KDV equation (KDVsoliton.m)
    * Interacting solitons (InteractingSolitons.m)
    * Box examples (boxExamples.m)
